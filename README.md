I have implemented the HTML files for my resume, biography, and the homepage
of the website. I also created a style sheet using CSS, which was applied to
all three of the HTML files. In this style sheet, I made the background pink,
created borders for the headers, centered the text, changed the color of the
biography paragraph, and resized the image. I took about 3 hours to complete the
lab. Since I have never studied HTML and CSS before, I spent a long time
familiarizing myself with the language. I loved this lab and had a lot of fun
changing the design of my website. I look forward to going more in depth into
these languages.
