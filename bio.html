<p> 

My birthday is April 19th, and I reside in northern New Jersey. I am a 
computer science student at Tufts University. 
One of my biggest passions apart from academics is music. I love to compose
my own pieces, and I am classically trained in the piano, violin, and voice. I
love spending time with my family and two dogs, and I also enjoy running and 
going to the beach. I hope to travel the world one day. My favorite subject is 
computer science, because it is so intriguing and challenging. I am really 
enjoying the web programming class, and I'm so excited that I can finally delve 
into the front-end world of computer science.
